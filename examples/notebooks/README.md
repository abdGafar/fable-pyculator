# Notebook Examples

This directory is reserved for public, sanitized FABLE Pyculator notebooks.

Do not commit original FABLE Calculator workbooks, generated Python clones, or raw validation reports
here. Put local working artifacts under `tmp/`.

- `fable-pyculator-2020-loop.ipynb`: rendered 2020 notebook-loop example.
- `fable-pyculator-2021-loop.ipynb`: 2021 notebook-loop template using the tracked compressed
  generated-model artifact.
- `fable-pyculator-2021-freshforge-build-plan.ipynb`: plan-first workflow showing how FABLE
  Pyculator, FreshForge, and Modelwright fit together when rebuilding the 2021 generated model from
  the source workbook.
- `fable-pyculator-2021-freshforge-run.ipynb`: run-oriented companion notebook that derives 2021
  output refs, writes the FreshForge workflow, and gates the full Modelwright build behind
  `RUN_FRESHFORGE = False`.

The FreshForge provider example in `../freshforge/fable_2021_notebook_workflow.yaml` is a plan-only
workflow graph for the same FABLE-specific notebook boundary.
