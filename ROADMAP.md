# Roadmap

This roadmap is the current project plan and issue tracker map for `fable-pyculator`.

The near-term direction is to build a FABLE Calculator-specific notebook/user-guide layer on top of
Modelwright-generated Python models while preserving Modelwright as the generic conversion engine.

## Current Next Steps

- Phase 8 is closed: the validated 2021 FABLE-C generated model is published as a compressed repo
  artifact, PR #60 merged, and post-merge Test and Docs Pages workflows passed.
- Phase 9 was reactivated after Phase 12 to fill the skipped FreshForge provider pilot slot with a
  thin plan-only provider over the package workflow helpers.
- Phase 10 is closed: the Abdulateef-facing 2021 FreshForge build-plan notebook is tracked, PR #67
  merged, and post-merge Test and Docs Pages workflows passed.
- Phase 11 is closed: the Abdulateef-facing 2021 FreshForge-run notebook is tracked, PR #74 merged,
  and post-merge Test and Docs Pages workflows passed.
- `v0.1.0a1` has been published to TestPyPI and PyPI; future release work should target a new
  version.
- Keep Sphinx docs deployment as a phase closeout gate: every phase PR must pass the docs build, and
  the merge to `main` must trigger the GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

## Phase 0: Governance Bootstrap

GitHub parent issue: #1.

Initial commit: `8a5577d`.

Status: complete.

Goal: establish the repository contract, roadmap, changelog, planning area, package/docs/test
scaffold, benchmark metadata, reference-document handling, and artifact hygiene for FABLE Pyculator.
This phase wraps the current uncommitted scaffold as bootstrap evidence.

- [x] P0.1 Establish project overview and agent operating contract. Child issue: #2.
  - [x] Add `AGENTS.md` customized for FABLE Pyculator.
  - [x] Define the project boundary relative to Modelwright.
  - [x] Record source workbook, generated-model, and local artifact rules.
- [x] P0.2 Establish roadmap, changelog, planning area, and artifact rules. Child issue: #3.
  - [x] Add `ROADMAP.md`.
  - [x] Add `CHANGE_LOG.md`.
  - [x] Add `planning/README.md`.
  - [x] Keep workbook binaries, generated models, extracts, logs, and validation reports under ignored
        `tmp/`.
- [x] P0.3 Capture current package/docs/test scaffold as bootstrap evidence. Child issue: #4.
  - [x] Add package metadata and importable `fable_pyculator` module.
  - [x] Add selection-control discovery and notebook control records.
  - [x] Add output-table discovery and pandas rendering helpers.
  - [x] Add Sphinx documentation scaffold and FABLE workbook structure notes.
  - [x] Add benchmark metadata and checksums for the public FABLE-C workbooks.
  - [x] Track the public 2020 FABLE Calculator documentation PDF under `reference/`.
- [x] P0.4 Define strict GitHub issue, branch, and PR workflow. Child issue: #5.
  - [x] Mirror Modelwright's parent issue, child issue, feature branch, PR, and changelog workflow.
  - [x] Allow issue-number placeholders until the public remote and `gh` access exist.
  - [x] Require roadmap, changelog, issue comments, and verification evidence to stay synchronized
        after issue mapping is active.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim FABLE Pyculator has a documented agent-assisted development workflow.
- May claim the current scaffold discovers FABLE-C selection controls and output tables for the
  inspected public workbook structure.
- Must not claim stable public API compatibility, arbitrary FABLE country-calculator support,
  production FABLE-P readiness, or full generated-model equivalence.

  - [x] Support trailing-star wildcard filters such as `DATA*` and `OUTPUT-*`.
  - [x] Preserve exact-tag behavior and `DIRECT`/`AUX` context-column defaults.
  - [x] Add unit tests and docs examples for wildcard filters.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim discovered FABLE-C output tables carry workbook-derived column flavour metadata for the
  inspected public workbook structures.

## Phase 11: FreshForge-Run 2021 Model Build Notebook

GitHub parent issue: #69.

Active branch: `feature/p11-freshforge-2021-run-notebook`.

Status: complete.

Goal: add an Abdulateef-facing notebook that derives 2021 output refs with FABLE Pyculator, writes a
FreshForge workflow, and optionally runs the Modelwright generated-model build through FreshForge's
serial local runner.

- [x] P11.1 Add FreshForge-run notebook template. Child issue: #70.
  - [x] Add `examples/notebooks/fable-pyculator-2021-freshforge-run.ipynb`.
  - [x] Derive `OUTPUT-*` output refs from the 2021 workbook structure.
  - [x] Write the Modelwright FreshForge workflow under ignored `tmp/generated-models/fable-2021/`.
  - [x] Gate execution behind `RUN_FRESHFORGE = False`.
- [x] P11.2 Add notebook static tests and artifact hygiene checks. Child issue: #71.
  - [x] Test that the notebook is unexecuted by default.
  - [x] Test that it uses FreshForge run APIs and only 2021 generated-model paths.
  - [x] Test that it contains no 2020 generated-model fallback.
- [x] P11.3 Update docs, README, roadmap, and changelog. Child issue: #72.
  - [x] Link the notebook from `examples/notebooks/README.md`.
  - [x] Link the notebook from the Sphinx notebook-control guide.
  - [x] Record Phase 11 evidence in roadmap and changelog.
- [x] P11.4 Verify, PR, deploy docs, and close phase. Child issue: #73.
  - [x] Run full local verification.
  - [x] Open PR and verify CI/docs.
  - [x] Confirm post-merge docs deployment.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim FABLE Pyculator has a gated notebook showing how to run the 2021 Modelwright build
  through FreshForge.
- Must not claim a new generated-model equivalence result beyond the existing Phase 8 validation
  evidence.
- Must keep source workbooks, decompressed generated models, raw reports, and run artifacts under
  ignored `tmp/` paths.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `examples/notebooks/fable-pyculator-2021-freshforge-run.ipynb`.
- The notebook derives FABLE `OUTPUT-*` refs, writes `output_refs.json`, prepares cached-workbook
  validation, writes a FreshForge workflow, validates/plans it, and gates `run_workflow(...)` behind
  `RUN_FRESHFORGE = False`.
- The notebook ends by loading the newly generated 2021 model, when present, and rendering FABLE
  Pyculator output tables/headline frames.
- Linked the notebook from examples and Sphinx docs.

Verification evidence:

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_examples.py` passed with 5 tests.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` passed with 39 tests and 9 workbook-backed skips.

  2021 workbook artifacts.
- `scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Closeout evidence:

- Phase 11 PR #74 merged to `main`.
- PR checks passed for quality, pytest/docs, and release artifacts.
- Post-merge Docs Pages workflow passed and deployed the new notebook download.

Release evidence:

- Tag `v0.1.0a1` was pushed from closeout commit `b52057f`.

  imported `fable_pyculator 0.1.0a1`.
- PyPI release workflow run `28272354876` passed, and a clean PyPI install smoke test imported
  `fable_pyculator 0.1.0a1`.

## Phase 7: 2021 Notebook Artifact Wiring And Generated-Model Guidance

GitHub parent issue: #48.

Active branch: `feature/p7-2021-artifact-wiring`.

Status: complete.

Goal: address first-user feedback that the 2020 example notebook is easy to misuse with a 2021
workbook and that the docs do not clearly explain where Modelwright generated-model artifacts come
from.

  - [x] Do not decompress or reference the 2020 Modelwright generated model archive.
  - [x] Add/update notebook tracking tests.
- [x] P7.3 Document generated-model artifact boundary. Child issue: #51.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Explain that FABLE Pyculator wraps Modelwright generated models but does not create
        generation contracts.
  - [x] Explain what `contract.json`, `expressions.json`, and `constants.json` are for.
  - [x] Document 2020 vs 2021 artifact paths and validation boundaries.
  - [x] Link the generated-model guide from README and Sphinx docs.
- [x] P7.4 Validate docs and close user-feedback loop. Child issue: #49.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Update roadmap and changelog.
  - [x] Run lint, tests, docs, release artifact checks, and workbook checksums.
  - [x] Record evidence.
  - [x] Close the phase through PR and docs deployment.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim FABLE Pyculator has explicit 2020 and 2021 notebook wrapper artifact paths.
- May claim 2021 workbook structure can be discovered by wrapper helpers.

  produced and validated.
- Must not claim FABLE Pyculator can generate Modelwright `contract.json`, `expressions.json`, or
  `constants.json` from a FABLE workbook.

Implementation evidence:

  `DEFAULT_2021_GENERATED_MODEL_PATH`, `build_2021_notebook_spec`, and `run_2021_notebook_loop`.
- Added `build_notebook_spec` as the shared explicit workbook-spec builder used by 2020 and 2021
  helpers.
- Preserved the existing 2020 helper behavior while loading 2020 and 2021 generated models under
  separate module names.
- Added `examples/notebooks/fable-pyculator-2021-loop.ipynb` as an unexecuted wiring template that
  checks for matching 2021 artifacts and never falls back to the 2020 generated model archive.
- Added `docs/guides/generated-model-artifacts.rst` documenting the artifact boundary, 2020/2021
  generated-model path contract, and Modelwright JSON generation inputs.
- Linked generated-model artifact guidance from README, Sphinx index, notebook-control docs, the
  2020 workflow guide, and validation-scope docs.
- Hardened release artifact smoke checks so installed wheels expose the new 2021 helper API.
- Created Modelwright follow-up issue UBC-FRESH/modelwright#201 for generated-model contract
  materialization documentation/tooling.

Verification evidence:

- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` passed with 36 tests and 9 workbook-backed skips.

- Phase 7 parent issue #48 is closed.
- Phase 7 PR #53 merged to `main` with merge commit `c51af36`.
- Post-merge `Test` workflow passed on `main`, including quality, pytest/docs, and release-artifact
  jobs.
- Post-merge `Docs Pages` workflow passed on `main`, including Sphinx build, Read the Docs theme
  artifact verification, artifact upload, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Phase 8: Validated 2021 Generated Model Publication

GitHub parent issue: #54.

Active branch: `feature/p8-validated-2021-generated-model`.

Status: complete.

Goal: add the public 2021 FABLE-C generated Python model to `fable-pyculator` with the same evidence
discipline used for the 2020 Modelwright benchmark: generate from the public 2021 workbook, validate
against cached workbook outputs, publish only an approved compressed generated-model artifact, and
document the exact validation boundary.

- [x] P8.1 Define 2021 validation contract and output universe. Child issue: #59.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Derive the 2021 output universe from the public 2021 workbook using the same comparable-output
        contract as the 2020 benchmark.
  - [x] Record comparable output counts and any non-comparable cached blanks separately.
  - [x] Keep raw workbook extracts, output refs, generated JSON files, logs, and validation reports
        under ignored `tmp/`.

  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Run Modelwright extraction, contract inference, code generation, execution, and cached-output
        validation from the 2021 workbook.
  - [x] Require status `pass`, zero mismatches, and match count equal to comparable output count before
        making any 2021 equivalence claim.
  - [x] If validation fails, record blocker taxonomy and do not publish an equivalence artifact.
- [x] P8.3 Publish compressed 2021 generated-model artifact. Child issue: #55.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Track only `examples/fable_2021/generated_fable_2021_model.py.xz` as the approved compact
        generated-model artifact.
  - [x] Add `examples/fable_2021/README.md` with source workbook checksum, validation counts,
        generation command outline, and artifact boundary.
  - [x] Keep source workbook, decompressed `.py`, generated JSON inputs, logs, and raw validation
        outputs ignored.
- [x] P8.4 Update 2021 notebook, docs, and Basecamp guidance. Child issue: #57.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Update the 2021 notebook to materialize the compressed 2021 generated model into the ignored
        `tmp/generated-models/fable-2021/` path.
  - [x] Update README, generated-model artifact docs, validation-scope docs, release docs, and
        notebook docs with the exact Phase 8 evidence.
  - [x] Update the Basecamp follow-up draft to point users to the published 2021 artifact and its
        validation boundary.
- [x] P8.5 Verify, merge, deploy docs, and close phase. Child issue: #56.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Add tests for the compressed 2021 artifact, notebook artifact references, and release artifact
        allowlisting.
  - [x] Run lint, tests, opt-in workbook tests, docs, theme verification, checksum verification, release
        artifact checks, and `git diff --check`.
  - [x] Open and merge the Phase 8 PR only after CI passes.
  - [x] Confirm post-merge `Test` and `Docs Pages` workflows pass and the deployed docs show the
        updated 2021 validation claim before closing the parent issue.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim 2021 generated-model equivalence only if the 2021 generated model validates with
  `0` comparable-output mismatches against the 2021 source workbook.
- Must record comparable output count, match count, mismatch count, and non-comparable cached blanks
  before publishing a validation claim.
- Must not track the 2021 source workbook, raw validation report, decompressed generated model,
  generated JSON inputs, logs, or ignored `tmp/` artifacts.
- Must not claim arbitrary country-calculator support, production readiness, or full FABLE-P model
  equivalence.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `examples/fable_2021/generated_fable_2021_model.py.xz` as the approved compressed generated
  model artifact.
- Added `examples/fable_2021/README.md` and `planning/phase-8-2021-validation-summary.md` with
  sanitized validation evidence and artifact boundaries.

  validation evidence.
- Hardened release artifact checks so only the approved compressed 2021 generated model is allowed.
- Modelwright PR #204 merged to `main` at `c3734d3`, closing issue #203 for the generic generated
  `VLOOKUP` `#N/A` runtime semantic fix uncovered by the 2021 validation run.

Verification evidence:

- Clean Phase 8 validation summary: 281,922 comparable outputs, 281,922 matches, 0 mismatches, 15,080
  non-comparable cached blank formula outputs, zero graph diagnostics, and zero translation
  diagnostics.
- Modelwright targeted checks for PR #204 passed before merge: `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_python_generation.py tests/test_generated_execution.py -q`.

  - [x] Use only public-safe ignored `tmp/` artifact paths.
  - [x] Compose FABLE Pyculator nodes around downstream Modelwright workflow artifact boundaries.
  - [x] Keep the example plan-only.
- [x] P9.4 Add docs and tests for provider discovery/planning. Child issue: #88.
  - [x] Add Sphinx provider guide.
  - [x] Link guide from docs index and API reference.
  - [x] Add tests for metadata, entry point, import boundary, example planning, and diagnostics.
  - [x] Keep FreshForge-present tests skipped when FreshForge is unavailable.
- [ ] P9.5 Verify, PR, and close phase. Child issue: #89.
  - [x] Run Ruff, pytest, Sphinx, docs theme verification, checksums, release artifact checks, and
        `git diff --check`.
  - [ ] Open PR from `feature/p9-fable-freshforge-provider` to `main`.
  - [ ] Merge only after CI passes.
  - [ ] Confirm post-merge `Test` and `Docs Pages` workflows before closing parent #61.

- May claim FABLE Pyculator exposes FABLE-specific workflow planning metadata to FreshForge.
- Must not claim FreshForge executes FABLE notebook loops or materializes artifacts.
- Must not move generic Modelwright conversion logic into FABLE Pyculator.
- Must not claim additional FABLE country-calculator compatibility from this planning layer alone.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `fable_pyculator.freshforge` with lazy FreshForge imports, provider id `fable_pyculator`,
  and a plan-only provider factory.
- Added plan-only node metadata for notebook spec discovery, output-ref derivation,
  validation-scenario preparation, Modelwright workflow construction, and notebook-loop planning.
- Added a PyPI-safe `freshforge.providers` entry point without adding a FreshForge runtime
  dependency.
- Added `examples/freshforge/fable_2021_notebook_workflow.yaml` as a public-safe plan-only workflow.
- Added `docs/guides/freshforge-provider-integration.rst`, linked it from the docs index and API
  reference, and added provider discovery/planning tests.

Verification evidence:

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_freshforge_integration.py -q` passed with 6 tests.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `examples/notebooks/fable-pyculator-2021-freshforge-build-plan.ipynb` as an unexecuted
  plan-first notebook for rebuilding the 2021 generated model.
- The notebook derives `OUTPUT-*` output refs from the 2021 workbook structure, writes a FreshForge
  Modelwright workflow graph under ignored `tmp/`, validates/plans the graph when FreshForge is
  installed, and shows gated Modelwright build commands behind `RUN_BUILD = False`.
- Linked the notebook from `examples/notebooks/README.md` and the notebook-control Sphinx guide.
- Added static notebook tests that verify the FreshForge/Modelwright/FABLE boundary and prevent a
  2020 generated-model fallback reference.
