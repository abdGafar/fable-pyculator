Release And Deployment
======================

FABLE Pyculator releases follow the same maintainer-controlled pattern as Modelwright. A release is
ready only when package artifacts, documentation, alpha-boundary claims, and publication gates have
all been checked.

Current Alpha Target
--------------------

The current alpha target is ``0.1.0a1`` with Git tag ``v0.1.0a1``.

This alpha may claim an early FABLE-C notebook wrapper that can discover the public 2020/2021
``SCENARIOS selection`` controls, inspect ``SCENARIOS definition`` tables, render canonical output
tables with output-column flavour filtering, render curated FOOD/LAND/GHG/WATER headline frames, and
run a locally restored Modelwright-generated 2020 model from ignored ``tmp/`` artifacts.

It must not claim stable public API compatibility, full editable scenario-definition widgets,
production readiness, full generated-model equivalence inside this repository, or arbitrary
country-calculator support.

Local Release Checks
--------------------

Start from a clean checkout and bootstrap the repo-local development environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   scripts/bootstrap_dev_env.sh

Run the normal local checks:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest -vv
   .venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W -v
   .venv/bin/python scripts/verify_docs_theme.py _build/html

Build and inspect package artifacts:

.. code-block:: bash

   scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh

The artifact checker writes outputs under ignored ``tmp/release-checks/``. It builds an sdist and
wheel, runs ``twine check``, inspects artifact contents for source workbooks or generated models,
installs the wheel into a clean virtual environment, imports FABLE Pyculator, and verifies the
published package version.

Documentation Deployment Gate
-----------------------------

The docs workflow builds Sphinx documentation and uploads the built HTML artifact to GitHub Pages.
The build must pass ``scripts/verify_docs_theme.py`` so the uploaded artifact uses the Sphinx Read the
Docs theme rather than a fallback site.

After a release PR merges to ``main``, verify the published GitHub Pages site from the workflow
deployment result. The deployed page should show the Read the Docs side navigation and should not look
like a plain project page.

TestPyPI Rehearsal
------------------

Use the ``Release`` GitHub Actions workflow with ``publish_target`` set to ``testpypi``.

Requirements:

- the ``testpypi`` environment must be configured by the maintainer;
- trusted publishing is preferred;
- no API tokens should be committed to the repository;
- the workflow must build artifacts before publishing them.

After TestPyPI publication, install the package from TestPyPI in a clean environment and run at
least:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ fable-pyculator==0.1.0a1
   python -c "import fable_pyculator; print(fable_pyculator.__version__)"

Real PyPI Publication
---------------------

Real PyPI publication requires maintainer approval and the protected ``pypi`` environment.

Expected sequence:

1. Confirm ``CHANGE_LOG.md`` and release notes describe the actual alpha boundary.
2. Confirm local and CI release artifact checks pass.
3. Confirm TestPyPI rehearsal passes or document the exact blocker.
4. Create the annotated tag, for example ``v0.1.0a1``.
5. Run the ``Release`` workflow or push the tag, then approve the protected PyPI environment.
6. Verify the package page, wheel install, import, docs deployment, and GitHub release notes.

Rollback And Yanking
--------------------

If a broken alpha reaches PyPI, do not reuse the same version. PyPI artifacts are immutable.

Use one of these responses:

- yank the broken release on PyPI if installation should be discouraged but historical availability is
  still useful;
- publish a new alpha such as ``0.1.0a2`` after fixing the issue;
- update release notes and roadmap entries with the failure mode and mitigation.

Private Data Rules
------------------

Release artifacts must not include source workbooks, generated Python clones, raw validation reports,
local logs, credentials, or ignored ``tmp/`` material.
