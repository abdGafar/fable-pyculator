FreshForge Provider Integration
===============================

FABLE Pyculator exposes a plan-only FreshForge provider for FABLE notebook workflow stages. The
provider helps FreshForge validate and plan FABLE-specific steps such as notebook-spec discovery,
output-ref derivation, validation-scenario preparation, downstream Modelwright workflow construction,
and notebook-loop planning.

This provider is deliberately not an execution adapter. FABLE Pyculator owns FABLE workbook-surface
knowledge; Modelwright owns generated-model inference, generation, execution, and validation; and
FreshForge owns workflow validation, planning, and provider orchestration.

Installation Boundary
---------------------

FABLE Pyculator registers a ``freshforge.providers`` entry point, but it does not depend on
FreshForge directly. Install FreshForge separately in development environments that need provider
discovery or workflow planning.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install "freshforge @ git+https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/freshforge.git@v0.1.0a1"

Normal imports remain FreshForge-free:

.. code-block:: python

   import fable_pyculator

Provider Nodes
--------------

The provider id is ``fable_pyculator``. Phase 9 exposes these plan-only node types:

``notebook_spec_discover``
   Declares FABLE workbook-surface discovery into a notebook-facing spec.

``output_refs_derive``
   Declares output-ref derivation from FABLE output-table flavour metadata such as ``OUTPUT-*``.

``validation_scenario_prepare``
   Declares cached-workbook validation-scenario preparation for selected output refs.

``modelwright_workflow_build``
   Declares construction of the downstream Modelwright FreshForge workflow document.

``notebook_loop_plan``
   Declares a notebook loop around a matching workbook spec and generated model.

The node vocabulary maps to the public workflow helper APIs documented in
:mod:`fable_pyculator.workflows`, including ``derive_output_refs``,
``build_cached_workbook_validation_scenario``, ``freshforge_2021_build_paths``, and
``build_modelwright_freshforge_workflow``.

Example
-------

The public-safe example workflow uses ignored ``tmp/`` paths and can be validated or planned when
FreshForge is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   freshforge validate examples/freshforge/fable_2021_notebook_workflow.yaml
   freshforge inspect examples/freshforge/fable_2021_notebook_workflow.yaml
   freshforge plan examples/freshforge/fable_2021_notebook_workflow.yaml

Planning this graph does not derive real output refs, inspect source workbooks, execute Modelwright,
or materialize generated artifacts. It proves only that the FABLE-specific planning boundary is
structured and discoverable.

Boundary
--------

The FABLE Pyculator provider may describe FABLE-specific workflow planning metadata. It must not:

- execute FABLE notebook loops;
- generate or validate Modelwright Python models;
- choose generic workbook conversion semantics;
- claim additional country-calculator compatibility from planning metadata alone.
